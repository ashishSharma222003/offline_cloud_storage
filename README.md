# P2P Messaging Application

## Overview

This project is a peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging application developed in Python. The application allows users to send and receive messages directly between peers without relying on a central server. This can be useful for creating decentralized communication systems or for educational purposes to understand P2P networking concepts.

## Features
